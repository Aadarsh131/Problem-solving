[1795. Rearrange Products Table](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-products-table/description/)

**MySql**

```sql
SELECT product_id, 'store1' as store, store1 as price FROM Products WHERE store1 IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, 'store2' as store, store2 as price FROM Products WHERE store2 IS NOT NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT product_id, 'store3' as store, store3 as price FROM Products WHERE store3 IS NOT NULL
```
- `UNION ALL` allows the duplicates as well
