[1484. Group Sold Products By The Date](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-sold-products-by-the-date/description/)

**MySql**
```sql
SELECT sell_date, COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product ORDER BY product SEPARATOR ',') AS products
FROM Activities
GROUP BY sell_date
```
- in `GROUP_CONCAT()` function, default `SEPARATOR` is `','`, so no need to explicitly specify it
