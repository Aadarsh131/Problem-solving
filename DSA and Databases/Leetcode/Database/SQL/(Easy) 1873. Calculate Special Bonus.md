[1873. Calculate Special Bonus](https://leetcode.com/problems/calculate-special-bonus/description/)

**MySQl**

```sql
SELECT employee_id, 
    CASE
        WHEN 
            employee_id % 2 <> 0 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%' THEN 1 * salary
        ELSE
            0
    END as bonus
FROM Employees ORDER BY employee_id
```

OR 

```sql
select employee_id , salary * ( employee_id%2 ) * ( name not like 'M%') as bonus
from employees
order by employee_id;
```
- returns `0` if either `(employee_id % 2)` is 0 OR `(name not like 'M%')` is `false`(i.e 0)
  
OR (using `IF`)
```sql
select 
    employee_id,
    if(employee_id%2!=0 and name NOT LIKE 'M%',salary,0) as bonus 
from Employees 
order by employee_id
```
