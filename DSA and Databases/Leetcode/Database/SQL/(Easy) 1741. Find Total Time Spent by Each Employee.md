[1741. Find Total Time Spent by Each Employee](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-total-time-spent-by-each-employee/description/)

**MySql**
1.  ```sql
    WITH cte AS (
        SELECT 
        *,
        SUM(out_time-in_time) OVER (Partition BY event_day, emp_id) AS total_time 
        FROM Employees
    )
    SELECT DISTINCT event_day as day,emp_id, total_time FROM cte;
    ```
    - we can use `PARTITION BY` on more than 1 column and `DISTINCT` must be applied to multiple columns if we need to use it here

2.  ```sql
    SELECT event_day as day, emp_id, SUM(out_time-in_time) as total_time 
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY day, emp_id; -- ordering of col doesn't matter
    -- OR
    -- GROUP BY 1,2;
    ```
    - we can `GRUOP BY` multiple columns
    - NOTE: changing of order (eg. `GROUP BY day, emp_id;`) only affect the sematics but result remains unchanged as all the columns are processed simultaneously. 
      - **When it does matter ?**- 
        - WHEN interpreting query in terms of readability/logic flow .
        - When combined with ROLLUP/CUBE: If used GROUP BY ... WITH ROLLUP or CUBE, the column order affects how subtotals and grand totals are calculated.
