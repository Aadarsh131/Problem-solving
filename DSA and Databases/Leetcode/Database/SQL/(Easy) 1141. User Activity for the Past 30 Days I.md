**MySql**  
1.  ```sql
    SELECT activity_date AS day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users FROM Activity 
    WHERE DATE(activity_date) between DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 29 DAY) AND DATE('2019-07-27')
    GROUP BY activity_date

    -- We are using `29` instead of `30` so that we can exclude the last date
    ```

2.  ```sql
    -- notice the (] nature of inclusivity
    SELECT activity_date AS day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users FROM Activity 
    WHERE DATE(activity_date) > DATE_SUB('2019-07-27', INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND DATE(activity_date) <= DATE('2019-07-27')
    GROUP BY activity_date
    ```
3.  ```sql
    SELECT activity_date AS day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users FROM Activity 
    WHERE DATEDIFF('2019-07-27', activity_date) < 30 AND DATEDIFF('2019-07-27',activity_date) >= 0 -- taking care of the -ve value
    GROUP BY activity_date
    ```
